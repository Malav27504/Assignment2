            Everything is great, no really<br>
            I haven't thought about my ex today<br>
            Oh, wait (fuck, I just did)<br>
            But I went outside for the first time<br>
            In a few days and it felt nice<br>
            And I might try doing exercise (haha, not really)</span><br><br>
            
            <span class="line2">I want to forget my bad days, all my bad days<br>
            And be okay, and be okay<br>
            Spend my spare change down at the arcade<br>
